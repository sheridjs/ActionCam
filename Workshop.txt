This cinematic camera mod attempts to follow the action in your city by showing you views of emergency and disaster response vehicles.

[h1]Notes[/h1]
[list]
[*] Cinematic camera scripts are mods, so they disable achievements.
[*] Vehicles and camera routines are picked at random. You may get duplicates in a row.
[*] Hearses are included under the health category. They are handled like any other vehicle, even if they aren't very action-packed.
[*] If no service vehicles are in the city at all, the camera will follow a random road in the city.

[h1]Future[/h1]
This script currently doesn't have a lot of smarts, and some camera routines might not make a lot of sense for the item being shown. I'd like to add some filters based on properties of the vehicles. For example, if a helicopter is chosen, different camera routines could be available.

If possible, I'd like to include certain buildings like buildings on fire or rubble. Currently the script only follows vehicles.
